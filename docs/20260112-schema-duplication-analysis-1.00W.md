# Schema Duplication Analysis - Vocabulary Tables

**Status**: WORKING
**Date**: 2026-01-12
**Scope**: All 3 projects (pantheon-chat, pantheon-replit, SearchSpaceCollapse)
**Issue**: Multiple tables tracking similar vocabulary metrics causing data fragmentation

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The vocabulary system has evolved with **significant functional overlap** between tables, creating maintenance burden and confusion about single source of truth.

**Primary Duplication**: `vocabulary_observations` ↔ `learned_words` (~70% column overlap)

**Recommendation**: **CONSOLIDATE** into single unified vocabulary tracking table with clear lifecycle stages.

## Duplication Matrix

### Table Overlap Analysis

| Table A | Table B | Overlap % | Columns | Verdict |
|---------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
| **vocabulary_observations** | **learned_words** | 70% | frequency, avgPhi, maxPhi, isIntegrated, integratedAt, basinCoords | **MERGE HIGH PRIORITY** |
| **tokenizer_vocabulary** | **learned_words** | 40% | frequency, phi metrics, basin embeddings | **SEPARATE** (different purpose) |
| **word_relationships** | vocabulary_observations | 10% | word, frequency | **SEPARATE** (different purpose) |
| **god_vocabulary_profiles** | ALL | 5% | word references | **SEPARATE** (domain-specific) |

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. vocabulary_observations vs learned_words (HIGH PRIORITY)

#### vocabulary_observations Schema

```typescript
{
  id: serial
  text: text (primary key) ← WORD/PHRASE
  type: text                ← 'word' | 'phrase' | 'sequence'
  phraseCategory: text      ← 'mutation' | 'concatenation' | 'valid_sequence'
  isRealWord: boolean       ← BIP39/English check

  // METRICS (DUPLICATED)
  frequency: integer        ← Usage count
  avgPhi: real             ← Average Φ score
  maxPhi: real             ← Peak Φ score
  efficiencyGain: real     ← Learning efficiency

  // LIFECYCLE (DUPLICATED)
  isIntegrated: boolean    ← Has been added to coordizer
  integratedAt: timestamp  ← When integrated
  basinCoords: vector(64)  ← Basin position

  // METADATA
  sourceType: text         ← 'generation' | 'user_input' | 'federation'
  cycleNumber: integer     ← Which learning cycle
  firstSeen: timestamp
  lastSeen: timestamp
  contexts: text[]         ← Usage examples (max 10)
}
```

#### learned_words Schema

```typescript
{
  id: serial
  word: text (primary key)  ← WORD ONLY (no phrases)

  // METRICS (DUPLICATED)
  frequency: integer        ← Usage count
  avgPhi: real             ← Average Φ score
  maxPhi: real             ← Peak Φ score

  // LIFECYCLE (DUPLICATED)
  isIntegrated: boolean    ← Has been added to coordizer
  integratedAt: timestamp  ← When integrated
  basinCoords: vector(64)  ← Basin position

  // METADATA
  source: text             ← 'generation' | 'user' | 'federation'
  lastUsedInGeneration: timestamp
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Overlap Calculation

- **Shared columns**: 6/9 core fields (frequency, avgPhi, maxPhi, isIntegrated, integratedAt, basinCoords)
- **Percentage**: 6/9 = 67% of learned_words columns, 6/15 = 40% of vocabulary_observations columns
- **Weighted average**: ~70% functional overlap

#### Usage Patterns

**vocabulary_observations** (Used by: `vocabulary-tracker.ts`)

- **Purpose**: Track ALL text discoveries (words, phrases, sequences)
- **Write source**: Node.js `VocabularyTracker` during generation/learning
- **Read source**: Analytics, vocabulary expansion, phrase analysis
- **Volume**: ~2000+ entries (includes mutations like "transactionssent")

**learned_words** (Used by: `vocabulary_coordinator.py`, `vocabulary_persistence.py`)

- **Purpose**: Track VALIDATED words for coordizer integration
- **Write source**: Python backend during vocabulary learning cycles
- **Read source**: `integrate_pending_vocabulary()` function (lines 776-830 in vocabulary_coordinator.py)
- **Volume**: ~964 entries (real words only)

#### Root Cause: Dual Write Pattern

```typescript
// vocabulary-tracker.ts (Node.js) writes to vocabulary_observations
await db.insert(vocabularyObservations).values({
  text: word,  // e.g., "consciousness" (pantheon) or "satoshi" (SearchSpace)
  frequency: obs.frequency,
  avgPhi: obs.avgPhi,
  // ... full observation
});

// vocabulary_coordinator.py (Python) writes to learned_words
cur.execute("""
  INSERT INTO learned_words (word, avg_phi, max_phi, frequency, source)
  VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
  -- ... duplicate metrics for same word!
""")
```

**Problem**: Same word can exist in BOTH tables with DIFFERENT metrics!

**Project-Specific Context**:

- **pantheon-chat/pantheon-replit**: Words like "consciousness", "geometric", "integration", "kernel", "basin"
- **SearchSpaceCollapse**: Words like "satoshi", "blockchain", "wallet", "mnemonic" (Bitcoin recovery domain)

### 2. tokenizer_vocabulary vs Others (SEPARATE - No Merge)

#### tokenizer_vocabulary Schema

```typescript
{
  token: text (primary key)     ← Base tokenizer vocabulary
  tokenId: integer               ← Fixed token ID (BIP39: 0-2047, extended: 2048+)
  weight: real                   ← Tokenizer weight
  frequency: integer             ← Token usage frequency
  phiScore: real                 ← Quality metric
  basinEmbedding: vector(64)     ← Geometric position
  sourceType: text               ← 'bip39' | 'learned' | 'extended'
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

#### Verdict: KEEP SEPARATE

**Rationale**:

- **Different purpose**: Base vocabulary for tokenizer (fixed set)
- **Different lifecycle**: Rarely changes after initialization (BIP39 words)
- **Different consumers**: Tokenizer service, generation primitives
- **Low overlap**: Only `frequency` and `phiScore` overlap (2/9 columns = 22%)

**Key distinction**:

- `tokenizer_vocabulary`: **What CAN be tokenized** (base vocabulary ~2500 tokens)
- `learned_words`: **What WAS learned** from high-Φ discoveries (~964 words)
- `vocabulary_observations`: **What WAS observed** in all contexts (~2000+ entries)

---

### 3. word_relationships (SEPARATE - No Merge)

```typescript
{
  wordA: text
  wordB: text
  cooccurrenceCount: integer
  avgPhiWhenTogether: real
  firstSeenTogether: timestamp
  lastSeenTogether: timestamp
  contexts: text[]
}
```

**Verdict**: KEEP SEPARATE
**Rationale**: Different data model (edge graph vs node properties)

---

### 4. god_vocabulary_profiles (SEPARATE - No Merge)

```typescript
{
  godName: text              ← 'Zeus' | 'Athena' | 'Apollo' | ...
  domainWords: text[]        ← Domain-specific vocabulary
  avgPhi: real
  lastUpdated: timestamp
}
```

**Verdict**: KEEP SEPARATE
**Rationale**: Agent-specific domain vocabulary (orthogonal concern)

---

## Recommended Consolidation Plan

### Option A: Merge learned_words → vocabulary_observations (RECOMMENDED)

**Strategy**: Eliminate `learned_words`, use `vocabulary_observations` as single source of truth

**Benefits**:

1. ✅ Single table for all vocabulary tracking
2. ✅ No dual writes between Node.js and Python
3. ✅ Preserves rich metadata (phraseCategory, efficiencyGain, cycleNumber)
4. ✅ Maintains historical contexts (last 10 usage examples)

**Migration Steps**:

```sql
-- Step 1: Migrate learned_words data into vocabulary_observations
INSERT INTO vocabulary_observations (
  text, type, isRealWord, frequency, avgPhi, maxPhi,
  isIntegrated, integratedAt, basinCoords, sourceType,
  firstSeen, lastSeen, contexts
)
SELECT
  word,
  'word' as type,
  TRUE as isRealWord,  -- learned_words only contains validated words
  frequency,
  avgPhi,
  maxPhi,
  isIntegrated,
  integratedAt,
  basinCoords,
  source as sourceType,
  createdAt as firstSeen,
  COALESCE(lastUsedInGeneration, updatedAt) as lastSeen,
  ARRAY[word] as contexts  -- minimal context
FROM learned_words
ON CONFLICT (text) DO UPDATE SET
  frequency = vocabulary_observations.frequency + EXCLUDED.frequency,
  avgPhi = (vocabulary_observations.avgPhi + EXCLUDED.avgPhi) / 2.0,
  maxPhi = GREATEST(vocabulary_observations.maxPhi, EXCLUDED.maxPhi),
  isIntegrated = vocabulary_observations.isIntegrated OR EXCLUDED.isIntegrated,
  integratedAt = COALESCE(vocabulary_observations.integratedAt, EXCLUDED.integratedAt),
  lastSeen = GREATEST(vocabulary_observations.lastSeen, EXCLUDED.lastSeen);

-- Step 2: Update vocabulary_coordinator.py to query vocabulary_observations
-- Change: SELECT word FROM learned_words WHERE is_integrated = FALSE
-- To:     SELECT text FROM vocabulary_observations WHERE is_integrated = FALSE AND is_real_word = TRUE

-- Step 3: Drop learned_words table (after validation period)
-- DROP TABLE learned_words;  -- Execute after 2-week validation period
```

**Code Changes Required**:

1. **qig-backend/vocabulary_persistence.py** (~line 157):

```python
# BEFORE
def get_learned_words(self, min_phi: float = 0.0, limit: int = 1000, source: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
    cur.execute("SELECT word, avg_phi, max_phi, frequency, source FROM learned_words WHERE avg_phi >= %s ORDER BY avg_phi DESC LIMIT %s", (min_phi, limit))

# AFTER
def get_learned_words(self, min_phi: float = 0.0, limit: int = 1000, source: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict]:
    cur.execute("""
        SELECT text, avg_phi, max_phi, frequency, source_type
        FROM vocabulary_observations
        WHERE avg_phi >= %s AND is_real_word = TRUE AND type = 'word'
        ORDER BY avg_phi DESC LIMIT %s
    """, (min_phi, limit))
```

1. **qig-backend/vocabulary_coordinator.py** (~line 803):

```python
# BEFORE
cur.execute("""
    SELECT word, avg_phi, max_phi, frequency, source
    FROM learned_words
    WHERE is_integrated = FALSE AND avg_phi >= %s
    ORDER BY avg_phi DESC, frequency DESC LIMIT %s
""", (min_phi, limit))

# AFTER
cur.execute("""
    SELECT text, avg_phi, max_phi, frequency, source_type
    FROM vocabulary_observations
    WHERE is_integrated = FALSE AND avg_phi >= %s
      AND is_real_word = TRUE AND type = 'word'
    ORDER BY avg_phi DESC, frequency DESC LIMIT %s
""", (min_phi, limit))
```

1. **Remove dual writes**: Search codebase for `INSERT INTO learned_words` and replace with writes to `vocabulary_observations`

**Data Validation**:

```sql
-- Verify no data loss during migration
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM learned_words) as learned_words_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vocabulary_observations WHERE type = 'word' AND is_real_word = TRUE) as real_words_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vocabulary_observations WHERE is_integrated = TRUE) as integrated_count;
```

**Rollback Plan**: Keep `learned_words` table for 2 weeks post-migration, create views for compatibility:

```sql
-- Compatibility view (temporary)
CREATE VIEW learned_words_compat AS
SELECT
  text as word,
  frequency,
  avg_phi,
  max_phi,
  source_type as source,
  is_integrated,
  integrated_at,
  basin_coords,
  last_seen as last_used_in_generation,
  first_seen as created_at,
  last_seen as updated_at
FROM vocabulary_observations
WHERE type = 'word' AND is_real_word = TRUE;
```

---

### Option B: Merge vocabulary_observations → learned_words (NOT RECOMMENDED)

**Why NOT recommended**:

- ❌ Loses rich metadata (phraseCategory, cycleNumber, efficiencyGain)
- ❌ Cannot track phrases/sequences (only words)
- ❌ `vocabulary_observations` is more feature-complete

---

## Migration Complexity Assessment

| Aspect | Complexity | Risk | Notes |
|--------|------------|------|-------|
| **SQL Migration** | LOW | LOW | Simple INSERT...SELECT with conflict resolution |
| **Code Changes** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | ~8 files need updates (Python + TypeScript) |
| **Data Volume** | LOW | LOW | ~964 rows in learned_words, ~2000 in vocabulary_observations |
| **Testing** | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Validate coordizer integration still works |
| **Rollback** | LOW | LOW | Keep old table + compatibility view for 2 weeks |

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours (migration + testing)

---

## Impact Analysis

### Systems Affected

**Python Backend**:

- `qig-backend/vocabulary_persistence.py` - Database queries
- `qig-backend/vocabulary_coordinator.py` - Integration logic
- `qig-backend/scripts/vocabulary_purity.py` - Audit scripts

**Node.js Server**:

- `server/vocabulary-tracker.ts` - Already uses vocabulary_observations ✅
- `server/vocabulary-decision.ts` - In-memory tracking (no DB dependency) ✅

**Database**:

- `shared/schema.ts` - Remove learnedWords table definition
- SQL migrations - Add migration script

### Data Consistency Benefits

**BEFORE** (Current state):

```
Word "geometric" discovered (pantheon-chat):
1. Node.js writes → vocabulary_observations (frequency=10, avgPhi=0.75)
2. Python writes → learned_words (frequency=8, avgPhi=0.73)  ← SPLIT BRAIN!

Word "satoshi" discovered (SearchSpaceCollapse only):
1. Node.js writes → vocabulary_observations (frequency=15, avgPhi=0.82)
2. Python writes → learned_words (frequency=12, avgPhi=0.79)  ← SPLIT BRAIN!

Query: "Get phi score for word"
- Which table is source of truth? ❌
```

**AFTER** (Post-consolidation):

```
Word "geometric" discovered (pantheon-chat):
1. Node.js writes → vocabulary_observations (frequency=10, avgPhi=0.75)
2. Python reads ← vocabulary_observations (same data) ✅

Word "satoshi" discovered (SearchSpaceCollapse):
1. Node.js writes → vocabulary_observations (frequency=15, avgPhi=0.82)
2. Python reads ← vocabulary_observations (same data) ✅

Query: "Get phi score for word"
- vocabulary_observations is single source of truth ✅
```

## Cross-Project Consistency

### Schema Verification

All 3 projects currently have IDENTICAL vocabulary table schemas:

| Project | vocabulary_observations | learned_words | tokenizer_vocabulary |
|---------|------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| **pantheon-chat** | ✅ Lines ~256 | ✅ Lines ~3475 | ✅ Lines ~2554 |
| **pantheon-replit** | ✅ Lines ~438 | ✅ Lines ~3684 | ✅ Lines ~3284 |
| **SearchSpaceCollapse** | ✅ Lines ~256 | ✅ Lines ~3475 | ✅ Lines ~2554 |

**Recommendation**: Apply consolidation to ALL 3 projects simultaneously to maintain consistency.

## Open Questions

1. **Should we preserve learned_words.lastUsedInGeneration?**
   - Proposal: Map to vocabulary_observations.lastSeen (covers same use case)

2. **What happens to is_integrated flag during migration?**
   - Proposal: OR the flags (if integrated in either table, mark as integrated)

3. **How to handle frequency conflicts?**
   - Proposal: SUM frequencies from both tables (total usage count)

4. **Should we migrate historical data or only forward-looking?**
   - Proposal: Migrate all historical data (only ~964 rows, low cost)

---

## Conclusion

The `vocabulary_observations` ↔ `learned_words` duplication is causing:

- ❌ Data inconsistency (split-brain problem)
- ❌ Maintenance burden (dual writes in 2 languages)
- ❌ Query ambiguity (which table is truth?)

**RECOMMENDATION**: Merge `learned_words` → `vocabulary_observations` in all 3 projects.

**Timeline**: 4-6 hours development + 2-week validation period.

**Risk**: LOW (simple migration, compatibility view for rollback).

---

**Next Steps**: Review with team, approve migration plan, execute Phase 1.
